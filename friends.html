    My friends mostly consist of just other giants. However on occasion we can coexist with other species such as select humans, grazing wildlife, and other alike mythical creatures such as golems. But for the most we are disliked by other mythical creatures

I hope that in creating this website I may reach out to make new friends. Eons ago my ancestors fought the ancient gods of Greece and Rome, but that time has long since passed and I do not see why we cannot just all coexist in harmony.

    Humans of the world have come together to live peacefully, apart from some global tensions here and there. I do not see it as far-fetched to think that someday we can all live together one the same planet. Surely there is enough room for all of us to spread out.
