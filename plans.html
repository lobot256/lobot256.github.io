  Now that I am discovered my plans are as followed: 
  <ol> <li> Make peace with the leaders of the world </li> 
  <li> Barter for sanctuary among the countries of Earth</li> 
  <li> Spread out my remaining friends and family</li>
  <li> Establish safe communication with them </li>
  <li> Secure trade and benefits within new homes</li></ol>
  </p>

  <p>
    Explaining stepy by-step in brief, the foremost important step is showing that we are peaceful. For too long have we been seen as vicious beasts, and I hope to finally stop that permeating image of us once and for all.  
<br>
    <br>
Next, surely there is an arrangement I can come to with the world leaders. Perhaps with my eons of age in experience of being so massive, I can offer them some knowledge or perhaps strength in the building of their cities and towns. 
<br>
    <br>
Once safety and home has been secured, next I will call for my family and friends to take refuge in the sanctuaries negotiated for. Establishing contact with them will be the most important thing next. Since most of them don’t have giant PCs like me, I need to be able to check in and make sure that the deal is always being adhered to, otherwise we may return into hiding once more .
<br>
    <br>
Lastly, I will up-hold my end of the deal, as will as the other giants, doing well to ensure the benefit of all sides. We wouldn’t dare free-load, and would certainly do well to benefit our new homes.
