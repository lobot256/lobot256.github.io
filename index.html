  My name is Fredrick the giant. I was born 2,000 years ago and recently I was discovered by the general population. In lou of this discovery, I picked up a giant PC from my giant best buy and decided to host a website to tell you my story. 
</p>
<p class="cus">
  In the navigation bar above you can more about who I am, what my kind is about, who my friends are, and what my plans are for the future after being discovered. Below is a simple collection of photos I have gathered from my perspective, in the hopes that we can someday see eye-to-eye.

    Some giants are mean, but I am very gentle and kind. I recognize the lives below my feet are unique, special, akin to my kind and me. I hope by extending this website to those who I tower above, we can begin to bridge the gaps between our kinds. 
  </p>
  <p>
    In the past, humans before had witnessed me as an enemy. While I am sure that some still do, I know that times have changed and this may not always be the case. I remain cautiously optimistic that an agreement can be made of peace.
