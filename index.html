  My name is Fredrick the giant. I was born 2,000 years ago and recently I was discovered by the general population. In lou of this discovery, I picked up a giant PC and decided to host a website to tell you my story.

<p>
  In the navigation bar above you can more about who I am, what my kind is about, who my friends are, and what my plans are for the future after being discovered. Below is a simple collection of photos I have gathered from my perspective, in the hopes that we can someday see eye-to-eye.
