    In Greek mythology it was said that there was a great battle between my kind and the Gods. It was referred to as the “Gigantomachy.” It was with the effort of Heracles the archer that they would succeed and banish us to the darker corner of the worlds. 
<br>
    <br>
In Norse mythology. we were seen primeval beings that existed before the gods... And also overcome by them. 
<br>
    <br>
Lastly, in European mythology, we were seen as beasts that could crush tall buildings into rubble. We were seen as inferior in intelligence but superior in strength. Brutish would only begin to describe our temperament, not to mention the cannibalism told in these folktales. 
<br>
    <br>
In all of these stories we were... Giant. Exceptionally tall, strong, measuring in one account of 40 feet tall.
